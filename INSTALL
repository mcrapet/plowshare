Plowshare installation notes.

Runtime dependencies
====================

To run plowshare you will need:

* GNU/Linux basic operating system: coreutils (chmod, date, ...), sed, util-linux (kill), grep.
  Note for BSD/Mac OSX: requires gnu-sed.
* Bash (version 4.1 or better). It will NOT work using Busybox or Dash (POSIX) shell.
* cURL (version 7.24 or better). Compiled with SSL support.

* Character encoding converter (to get proper filenames). This is optional.
  - recode or
  - perl and HTML::Entities module

* Javascript interpreter. Used by few modules (mostly plowdown).
  - spidermonkey or
  - rhino (JavaScript engine written in Java)

Some websites are using captchas. If you're not using an automatic solving service,
you'll need a (X11, FB or ascii) picture viewer.

* X11 viewers
  - display (imagemagick, X11) or
  - sxiv (imlib2, X11, very fast) or
  - feh (imlib2, X11) or
  - qiv (imlib2, X11)

* Framebuffer viewers
  - fbi (frame buffer image viewer) or
  - fim (frame buffer and ascii art image viewer)

* Ascii text viewers
  - aview (libaa) or
  - img2txt (libcaca) or
  - tiv (perl script using Image::Magick, color output)


Installation (core)
============
This is the instructions to install plowshare. Plowshare modules installation is described in the next section.
No compiler is required, it's only Bash scripts!

1) Automatic method: distro packages

This is the easiest method, Plowshare is available for several Linux distribution:

# Archlinux (https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/plowshare/)
$ yaourt -Sy plowshare

# Gentoo (http://packages.gentoo.org/package/net-misc/plowshare)
$ emerge -av plowshare

# Debian (https://packages.debian.org/sid/plowshare)
# Note: For Debian 8 "Jessie", the package is called plowshare4. Recent versions are included in jessie-backports.
$ apt-get install plowshare

# Mac OS X with Homebrew
$ brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
$ brew install plowshare
Note: gnu-sed will be installed as 'gsed', plowshare won't be able to find it with that name; you got two options:
  1) $ brew reinstall gnu-sed --with-default-names
  2) $ PATH="/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"


# Fedora & CentOS (https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/plowshare)
$ yum install plowshare

Note: You'll probably need to be root to install the plowshare package.

2) Manual method: from git sources

$ git clone https://github.com/mcrapet/plowshare.git

# If you have root privileges (like Ubuntu)
$ sudo make install

# For non root users, you can override default prefix (/usr)
# (make sure you have $HOME/local/bin in you PATH)
$ make install PREFIX=$HOME/local

Note for BSD users
------------------
You must manually install from sources.
You'll need GNU make (not bmake) and gnu-sed (or gsed) installed.
Don't forget to properly define GNU_SED variable.

# For example
$ make install patch_gnused GNU_SED=/opt/bin/gnu-sed PREFIX=/usr

Advanced users and maintainers
------------------------------

# If you are on a cross compilation environment:
# (default prefix is /usr)
$ make install DESTDIR=/media/rootfs
or
$ make install PREFIX=/opt DESTDIR=/media/rootfs


Installation (external modules)
============

1) Automatic method: using plowmod

$ plowmod --install

plowmod is a simple tool for managing your modules directory (~/.config/plowshare/modules.d).

If git (>1.8.5) is installed on your system, you can use later:
$ plowmod --update

Plowmod can handle 3rd part repositories. See man page for more information.

2) Manual method: from sources

$ mkdir -p ~/.config/plowshare/modules.d
$ cd ~/.config/plowshare/modules.d
$ curl -L -k https://github.com/mcrapet/plowshare-modules-legacy/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zxf -
$ mv plowshare-modules-legacy-master legacy

# vim:fileencoding=utf-8
